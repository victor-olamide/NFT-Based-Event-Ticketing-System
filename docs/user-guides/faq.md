# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Find answers to the most common questions about the NFT Event Ticketing System.

## 🎫 General Questions

### What are NFT tickets?

NFT tickets are digital tickets stored on the blockchain as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Each ticket is unique, verifiable, and cannot be counterfeited or duplicated. They provide secure, fraud-proof event entry while enabling features like resale tracking and royalty payments.

### Why use NFT tickets instead of traditional tickets?

**Benefits include:**
- **Fraud Prevention**: Impossible to counterfeit or duplicate
- **Transparent Pricing**: All transactions visible on blockchain
- **Anti-Scalping**: Price limits and transfer controls
- **Instant Verification**: Real-time authenticity checking
- **Collectible Value**: Tickets remain as digital collectibles
- **Creator Support**: Royalties on secondary sales

### What blockchain network is used?

The system runs on **Base**, an Ethereum Layer 2 network that offers:
- Very low transaction fees (typically $0.25-2.00)
- Fast transaction confirmation (2-5 seconds)
- High security and reliability
- Easy integration with popular wallets

### Do I need cryptocurrency experience?

Basic knowledge is helpful but not required. Our guides cover:
- Setting up a Web3 wallet
- Getting ETH on Base network
- Making your first transaction
- Understanding gas fees
- Managing your tickets

## 💰 Costs and Fees

### How much do transactions cost?

**Typical Costs on Base Network:**
- Creating an event: $1-3 in gas fees
- Buying a ticket: $0.25-1.00 in gas fees + ticket price
- Listing for resale: $0.50-2.00 in gas fees
- Marketplace purchase: 2.5% platform fee + royalties + gas

### What are gas fees?

Gas fees are network transaction costs paid to blockchain validators. On Base, these are very low compared to Ethereum mainnet. Fees vary based on network congestion but are typically under $2.

### Are there platform fees?

**Platform Fees:**
- **Primary Sales**: No platform fee (only gas fees)
- **Marketplace Sales**: 2.5% of sale price
- **Royalties**: 0-10% set by event organizers

### Can I get refunds?

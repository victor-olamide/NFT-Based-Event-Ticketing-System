## 1. Understanding NFT Tickets

### What Are NFT Tickets?

NFT tickets are digital tickets stored on the blockchain that:
- **Cannot be counterfeited**: Each ticket is unique and verifiable
- **Cannot be duplicated**: Impossible to create fake copies
- **Are instantly verifiable**: Real-time blockchain verification
- **Track usage**: System knows if ticket was already used
- **Provide transparency**: All transactions are recorded

### Key Advantages for Venues

**Fraud Prevention**
- 100% authentic tickets guaranteed
- No fake or counterfeit tickets possible
- Real-time verification system
- Instant fraud detection

**Operational Efficiency**
- Faster entry processing
- Reduced staff training needs
- Automatic attendance tracking
- Digital record keeping

**Cost Savings**
- No physical ticket printing
- Reduced security concerns
- Lower fraud-related losses
- Streamlined operations

### How Verification Works

1. **Attendee presents QR code** on phone or paper
2. **Staff scans QR code** with verification device
3. **System checks blockchain** for ticket authenticity
4. **Ticket marked as used** to prevent reuse
5. **Entry granted or denied** based on verification

   - Ask them to increase brightness if needed

2. **Position scanner properly**
   - Hold device 6-12 inches from QR code
   - Ensure QR code fills most of screen
   - Keep device steady
   - Wait for automatic focus

3. **Scan the code**
   - App will automatically detect and scan
   - Wait for verification result
   - Do not move device until complete
   - Listen for confirmation sound

4. **Check result**
   - Green = Valid ticket, allow entry
   - Red = Invalid/used ticket, deny entry
   - Yellow = Warning, check details

### Scanning Best Practices

**For Phone Screens**
- Ask attendee to increase brightness
- Ensure screen is clean
- Position at slight angle to reduce glare
- Use device's flashlight if needed

**For Printed QR Codes**
- Ensure paper is flat and unwrinkled
- Check for damage or smudging
- Use additional lighting if necessary
- Verify print quality is adequate

**Environmental Considerations**
- Bright sunlight: Use shade or device hood
- Low light: Use device flashlight
- Rain: Protect equipment and QR codes
- Crowds: Maintain orderly scanning process

## 4. Handling Verification Results

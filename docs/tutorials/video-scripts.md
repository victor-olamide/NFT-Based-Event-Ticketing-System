## 🎬 Tutorial 1: "Getting Started - Your First NFT Ticket" (5 minutes)

### Script Overview
**Target Audience**: Complete beginners to Web3 and NFT tickets
**Duration**: 5 minutes
**Goal**: Get users from zero to purchasing their first ticket

### Script

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]**
```
HOST: "Hi everyone! Welcome to NFT Event Ticketing on Base. I'm [Name], and today I'll show you how to buy your first NFT ticket in just 5 minutes. 

If you've never used cryptocurrency before, don't worry - I'll walk you through every step. By the end of this video, you'll have a secure wallet and know exactly how to buy tickets for your favorite events.

Let's get started!"

[SCREEN: Show platform homepage with events]
```

**[WALLET SETUP - 0:30-2:00]**
```
HOST: "First, we need a digital wallet. Think of this like a digital purse that holds your tickets and cryptocurrency.

[SCREEN: Show Coinbase Wallet download page]

I recommend Coinbase Wallet for beginners. It's user-friendly and works great with Base network.

Step 1: Download the Coinbase Wallet app from your app store.

[SCREEN: Show app store download]

Step 2: Open the app and tap 'Create new wallet'

[SCREEN: Show wallet creation process]

Step 3: Choose a username - this is just for identification.

Step 4: This is CRITICAL - back up your wallet. I'm choosing cloud backup for simplicity, but you can also write down the recovery phrase.

[SCREEN: Show backup options]

Step 5: Set up Face ID or fingerprint for security.

Great! Your wallet is ready. Now we need to add the Base network."

[SCREEN: Show network settings]
```

**[GETTING ETH - 2:00-3:30]**
```
HOST: "Now we need some ETH on Base network to buy tickets. ETH is like digital cash.

The easiest way is to bridge from Ethereum if you already have ETH, or buy directly through Coinbase.

[SCREEN: Show bridge.base.org]

I'll use the Base bridge. Go to bridge.base.org and connect your wallet.

[SCREEN: Show bridge interface]

I'm bridging $50 worth of ETH - that's enough for several tickets plus transaction fees.

Enter the amount, review the fees, and confirm. This takes about 10 minutes.

[SCREEN: Show transaction confirmation]

While we wait, let me show you the ticketing platform."

[SCREEN: Switch to ticketing platform]
```

**[BUYING TICKET - 3:30-4:30]**
```
HOST: "Here's the NFT Event Ticketing platform. You can see all available events.

[SCREEN: Show event listings]

Let's buy a ticket for this music festival. Click on the event to see details.

[SCREEN: Show event details page]

Perfect! Here's all the information - date, venue, price. I'll click 'Buy Ticket'.

[SCREEN: Show purchase flow]

Connect your wallet when prompted. Make sure you're on Base network.

[SCREEN: Show wallet connection]

Review the details carefully - event name, date, total cost including gas fees.

Click 'Buy Ticket' and confirm in your wallet.

[SCREEN: Show transaction confirmation]

Success! The transaction confirmed in just 3 seconds. That's the power of Base network."
```

**[USING TICKET - 4:30-5:00]**
```
HOST: "Your ticket is now in your wallet as an NFT. Go to 'My Tickets' to see it.

[SCREEN: Show ticket in wallet]

Here's your QR code - this is what you'll show at the venue. Screenshot this and save it to your photos as backup.

[SCREEN: Show QR code]

At the event, just show this QR code to venue staff. They'll scan it, verify it's authentic, and let you in.

That's it! You've successfully bought your first NFT ticket. Welcome to the future of event ticketing!

## 🎬 Tutorial 2: "Event Organizers - Create Your First Event" (8 minutes)

### Script Overview
**Target Audience**: Event organizers new to NFT ticketing
**Duration**: 8 minutes
**Goal**: Complete event creation with best practices

### Script

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:45]**
```
HOST: "Welcome event organizers! I'm [Name], and today I'll show you how to create your first NFT event on Base network.

NFT tickets offer incredible benefits: they're fraud-proof, give you royalties on resales, and provide anti-scalping protection for your fans.

[SCREEN: Show successful event examples]

In this tutorial, we'll create a complete event from scratch, including pricing strategy, anti-scalping settings, and royalty configuration.

Whether you're organizing concerts, conferences, or community events, this guide will get you started.

Let's dive in!"
```

**[PLATFORM OVERVIEW - 0:45-1:30]**
```
HOST: "First, let's connect our wallet and explore the organizer dashboard.

[SCREEN: Show platform connection]

I'm using MetaMask, but any Web3 wallet works. Make sure you're on Base network.

[SCREEN: Show organizer dashboard]

Here's the organizer dashboard. You can see analytics, manage events, and track sales.

Click 'Create Event' to get started.

[SCREEN: Show event creation form]

This form captures all your event details. Let's fill it out step by step."
```

**[EVENT DETAILS - 1:30-3:00]**
```
HOST: "Let's create a music festival called 'Base Beats 2024'.

[SCREEN: Fill in event name]

Event Name: Keep it clear and memorable. 'Base Beats 2024' tells people exactly what and when.

Description: This is your marketing copy. Mention key artists, venue highlights, and what makes your event special.

[SCREEN: Fill in description]

Date and Time: Use the date picker. I'm setting this for next month to give plenty of time for sales.

Venue: Include the full address. This helps with SEO and attendee planning.

[SCREEN: Fill in venue details]

Now for the important part - ticket configuration."
```

**[TICKET CONFIGURATION - 3:00-4:30]**
```
HOST: "Total Tickets: I'm setting 1000 tickets for this venue capacity.

Ticket Price: Research is key here. Similar festivals charge 0.08-0.12 ETH. I'll set 0.1 ETH - that's about $200 at current rates.

[SCREEN: Show pricing research]

Remember, buyers also pay gas fees, so factor that into your pricing strategy.

Seat Numbering: For general admission, I'll use sequential numbering 1-1000. For reserved seating, you'd set up sections.

[SCREEN: Show numbering options]

This is where NFT tickets really shine - let's configure anti-scalping protection."
```

**[ANTI-SCALPING SETUP - 4:30-6:00]**
```
HOST: "Maximum Transfer Price: This prevents excessive scalping. I'm setting 0.13 ETH - that's 30% above original price.

[SCREEN: Show transfer price setting]

This protects your fans while allowing reasonable resales for people who can't attend.

Transfer Settings: I'm enabling transfers because fans should be able to give tickets to friends or resell if needed.

[SCREEN: Show transfer toggle]

If you want maximum anti-scalping protection, you can disable transfers entirely, but this reduces flexibility for legitimate buyers.

Now let's set up royalties - this is passive income for you!"
```

**[ROYALTY CONFIGURATION - 6:00-7:00]**
```
HOST: "Royalty Percentage: Every time someone resells your ticket, you earn a percentage. I'm setting 7% - that's standard for music events.

[SCREEN: Show royalty setting]

Let's do the math: If someone resells a 0.1 ETH ticket for 0.13 ETH, you earn 7% of 0.13 ETH = 0.0091 ETH per resale.

Royalty Recipient: This is usually your wallet address, but could be a band's wallet or multi-sig for organizations.

[SCREEN: Show recipient setting]

This creates ongoing revenue streams from your events - pretty amazing!"
```

**[LAUNCH EVENT - 7:00-7:45]**
```
HOST: "Let's review everything before launching:
- Event details look good
- Pricing is competitive
- Anti-scalping protection is set
- Royalties configured

[SCREEN: Show review page]

The gas fee for creating this event is about $2 - much cheaper than traditional platform setup fees.

Click 'Create Event' and confirm in your wallet.

[SCREEN: Show transaction confirmation]

Success! Your event is now live and accepting ticket sales."
```

**[WRAP UP - 7:45-8:00]**
```
HOST: "Congratulations! You've created your first NFT event. 

Your event page is live, tickets are available for purchase, and you'll start earning royalties on any resales.

Next steps: Share your event link, engage with your community, and watch the sales roll in.

```

**[SCANNING PROCESS - 1:15-2:30]**
```
HOST: "When a guest approaches, ask them to present their QR code. This could be on their phone or printed.

[SCREEN: Show guest presenting phone]

Position your device 6-12 inches from the QR code. The app will automatically detect and scan.

[SCREEN: Show scanning in action]

Keep the device steady and wait for the result:

- Green = Valid ticket, allow entry
- Red = Invalid or used ticket, deny entry  
- Yellow = Warning, check with supervisor

[SCREEN: Show different result colors]

For phone screens, ask guests to increase brightness if the code is hard to see.

[SCREEN: Show brightness adjustment]

The scan takes 1-3 seconds and automatically marks the ticket as used to prevent reentry."
```

**[TROUBLESHOOTING - 2:30-3:30]**
```
HOST: "Let's handle common issues:

QR Code Won't Scan:
- Ask guest to clean their screen
- Try different angles and distances
- Use your device's flashlight in dark conditions
- Check if the QR code is damaged

[SCREEN: Show troubleshooting steps]

'Ticket Already Used' Error:
- This means someone already entered with this ticket
- Politely explain the situation
- Call your supervisor for verification
- Check if the ticket was legitimately transferred

[SCREEN: Show error handling]

Network Connection Issues:
- Most scans work offline after initial sync
- Use backup verification methods if needed
- Contact technical support
- Document manual entries for later system update

[SCREEN: Show backup procedures]
```

**[SPECIAL SITUATIONS - 3:30-4:00]**
```
HOST: "Handling special cases:

Lost Phone: Guest can show ticket from email backup or use a friend's device with their wallet.

Suspicious Activity: Multiple people with same QR code means ticket was likely transferred or stolen. Verify with ID and purchase confirmation.

System Failure: Use manual guest lists and verify ID. Document all entries for system update later.

[SCREEN: Show documentation process]

Remember: Stay calm, be professional, and prioritize security while helping guests.

Your role ensures everyone has a safe, smooth entry experience.

Questions? Contact your supervisor or technical support immediately.

Thanks for keeping events secure!"

```
HOST: "Let's find tickets for this popular concert. Go to the Marketplace section and use the filters.

[SCREEN: Show marketplace filters]

I'm filtering by event name and price range. Look at these options:

[SCREEN: Show ticket listings]

Here's how to evaluate listings:

Price Comparison: Original price was 0.1 ETH. These range from 0.11 to 0.14 ETH - that's 10-40% markup.

[SCREEN: Show price analysis]

Seller History: This seller has 15 successful sales - good reputation. This one has no history - higher risk but not necessarily bad.

Seat Quality: Section A costs more but has better views. Section C is cheaper but further back.

[SCREEN: Show seating comparison]

I'll choose this Section B ticket for 0.12 ETH - good balance of price and location.

Click on the listing to see full details.

[SCREEN: Show listing details]

Review everything carefully:
- Event date and time
- Seat number
- Total cost including fees
- Seller information

The total cost is 0.12 ETH + 0.003 ETH platform fee + 0.006 ETH royalty + gas = about 0.13 ETH.

Click 'Buy Ticket' and confirm in your wallet.

[SCREEN: Show purchase confirmation]

Success! The ticket transfers to my wallet immediately."
```

**[SELLING YOUR TICKETS - 2:30-4:30]**
```
HOST: "Now let's sell a ticket. Go to 'My Tickets' and select one to sell.

[SCREEN: Show ticket selection]

Click 'List for Sale'. First, I need to approve the marketplace to transfer my ticket.

[SCREEN: Show approval transaction]

This one-time approval costs a small gas fee but lets you list multiple tickets later.

Now set your price. Let's research the market first.

[SCREEN: Show market research]

Similar tickets are listed at 0.115-0.125 ETH. The original price was 0.1 ETH, and the maximum allowed is 0.15 ETH.

I'll price at 0.118 ETH - competitive but fair.

[SCREEN: Show price setting]

Here's the fee breakdown:
- Sale price: 0.118 ETH
- Platform fee (2.5%): 0.00295 ETH  
- Organizer royalty (5%): 0.0059 ETH
- You receive: 0.10915 ETH

That's about 9% profit after fees.

Confirm the listing and pay the gas fee.

Your ticket is now live on the marketplace!"
